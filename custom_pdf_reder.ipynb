The bestperforming models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attentionmechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer,based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutionsentirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models tobe superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring signiﬁcantlyless time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, includingensembles by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task,our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.0 aftertraining for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of thebest models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well toother tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both withlarge and limited training data.1IntroductionRecurrent neural networks, long short-term memory [12] and gated recurrent [7] neural networksin particular, have been ﬁrmly established as state of the art approaches in sequence modeling andtransduction problems such as language modeling and machine translation [31,2,5]. Numerousefforts have since continued to push the boundaries of recurrent language models and encoder-decoderarchitectures [34, 22, 14].Recurrent models typically factor computation along the symbol positions of the input and outputsequences. Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hiddenstatesht, as a function of the previous hidden stateht−1and the input for positiont. This inherentlysequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longersequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples. Recent work has achievedsigniﬁcant improvements in computational efﬁciency through factorization tricks [19] and conditional∗Equal contribution.

      "Sentence: computation [29], while also improving model performance in case of the latter. The fundamentalconstraint of sequential computation, however, remains.Attention mechanisms have become an integral part of compelling sequence modeling and transduc-tion models in various tasks, allowing modeling of dependencies without regard to their distance inthe input or output sequences [2,17]. In all but a few cases [25], however, such attention mechanismsare used in conjunction with a recurrent network.In this work we propose the Transformer, a model architecture eschewing recurrence and insteadrelying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output.The Transformer allows for signiﬁcantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art intranslation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs.2BackgroundThe goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of the Extended Neural GPU[21], ByteNet [16] and ConvS2S [9], all of which use convolutional neural networks as basic buildingblock, computing hidden representations in parallel for all input and output positions. In these models,the number of operations required to relate signals from two arbitrary input or output positions growsin the distance between positions, linearly for ConvS2S and logarithmically for ByteNet. This makesit more difﬁcult to learn dependencies between distant positions [11]. In the Transformer this isreduced to a constant number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution dueto averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi-Head Attention asdescribed in section 3.2.Self-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positionsof a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence. Self-attention has beenused successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization,textual entailment and learning task-independent sentence representations [4, 25, 26, 20].To the best of our knowledge, however, the Transformer is the ﬁrst transduction model relyingentirely on self-attention to compute representations of its input and output without using RNNs orconvolution. In the following sections, we will describe the Transformer, motivate self-attention anddiscuss its advantages over models such as [15, 16] and [9].3Model ArchitectureMost competitive neural sequence transduction models have an encoder-decoder structure [5,2,31].Here, the encoder maps an input sequence of symbol representations(x1, ..., xn)to a sequenceof continuous representationsz= (z1, ..., zn). Givenz, the decoder then generates an outputsequence(y1, ..., ym)of symbols one element at a time. At each step the model is auto-regressive[10], consuming the previously generated symbols as additional input when generating the next.The Transformer follows this overall architecture using stacked self-attention and point-wise, fullyconnected layers for both the encoder and decoder, shown in the left and right halves of Figure 1,respectively.3.1Encoder and Decoder StacksEncoder:The encoder is composed of a stack ofN= 6identical layers. Each layer has twosub-layers. The ﬁrst is a multi-head self-attention mechanism, and the second is a simple, position-wise fully connected feed-forward network. We employ a residual connection around each ofthe two sub-layers, followed by layer normalization [1]. That is, the output of each sub-layer isLayerNorm(x+ Sublayer(x)), whereSublayer(x)is the function implemented by the sub-layeritself. To facilitate these residual connections, all sub-layers in the model, as well as the embeddinglayers, produce outputs of dimensiondmodel= 512.Decoder:The decoder is also composed of a stack ofN= 6identical layers. In addition to the twosub-layers in each encoder layer, the decoder inserts a third sub-layer, which performs multi-headattention over the output of the encoder stack. Similar to the encoder, we employ residual connections2\n",

(right) Multi-Head Attention consists of severalattention layers running in parallel.The two most commonly used attention functions are additive attention [2], and dot-product (multi-plicative) attention. Dot-product attention is identical to our algorithm, except for the scaling factorof√dk. Additive attention computes the compatibility function using a feed-forward network witha single hidden layer. While the two are similar in theoretical complexity, dot-product attention ismuch faster and more space-efﬁcient in practice, since it can be implemented using highly optimizedmatrix multiplication code.While for small values ofdkthe two mechanisms perform similarly, additive attention outperformsdot product attention without scaling for larger values ofdk[3]. We suspect this to be caused by thedot products growing too large in magnitude to result in useful gradients after applying the softmaxfunction. To counteract this, we scale the dot product by1/√dk.3.2.2Multi-Head AttentionInstead of performing a single attention function withdmodel-dimensional keys, values and queries,we found it beneﬁcial to linearly project the queries, keys and valueshtimes with different, learnedlinear projections todk,dkanddvdimensions, respectively. On each of these projected versions ofqueries, keys and values we then perform the attention function in parallel, yieldingdv-dimensionaloutput values. These are concatenated, resulting in the ﬁnal values, as depicted in Figure 2Multi-head attention allows the model to jointly attend to information from different representationsubspaces at different positions. With a single attention head, averaging inhibits this.MultiHead(Q, K, V) = Concat(head1, ...,headh)whereheadi= Attention(QWQi, KWKi, V WVi)Where the projections are parameter matricesWQi∈Rdmodel×dk,WKi∈Rdmodel×dkandWVi∈Rdmodel×dv.In this work we employh= 8parallel attention layers, or heads. For each of these we usedk=dv=dmodel/h= 64. Due to the reduced dimension of each head, the total computational costis similar to that of single-head attention with full dimensionality.3.2.3Applications of Attention in our ModelThe Transformer uses multi-head attention in three different ways:•In the encoder-decoder attention layers, the queries come from the previous decoder layer,and the memory keys and values come from the output of the encoder.

This mimics thetypical encoder-decoder attention mechanisms in sequence-to-sequence models such as[34, 2, 9].•The encoder contains self-attention layers. In a self-attention layer all of the keys, valuesand queries come from the same place, in this case, the output of the previous layer in theencoder. Each position in the encoder can attend to all positions in the previous layer of theencoder.•Similarly, self-attention layers in the decoder allow each position in the decoder to attend toall positions in the decoder up to and including that position. We need to prevent leftwardinformation ﬂow in the decoder to preserve the auto-regressive property. We implement thisinside of scaled dot-product attention by masking out (setting to−∞) all values in the inputof the softmax which correspond to illegal connections. See Figure 2.3.3Position-wise Feed-Forward NetworksIn addition to attention sub-layers, each of the layers in our encoder and decoder contains a fullyconnected feed-forward network, which is applied to each position separately and identically. Thisconsists of two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between.FFN(x) = max(0, xW1+b1)W2+b2(2)While the linear transformations are the same across different positions, they use different parametersfrom layer to layer. The dimension of input and output isdmodel, and the inner-layer has dimension2048.3.4Embeddings and SoftmaxSimilarly to other sequence transduction models, we use learned embeddings to convert the inputtokens and output tokens to vectors of dimensiondmodel. We also use the usual learned linear transfor-mation and softmax function to convert the decoder output to predicted next-token probabilities. Inour model, we share the same weight matrix between the two embedding layers and the pre-softmaxlinear transformation. In the embedding layers, we multiply those weights by√dmodel.3.5Positional EncodingSince our model contains no recurrence and no convolution, in order for the model to make use of theorder of the sequence, we must inject some information about the relative or absolute position of thetokens in the sequence. To this end, we add \"positional encodings\" to the input embeddings at thebottoms of the encoder and decoder stacks. The positional encodings have the same dimensiondmodelas the embeddings, so that the two can be summed. There are many choices of positional encodings,learned and ﬁxed [9].In this work, we use sine and cosine functions of different frequencies:PE(pos,2i)=sin(pos/100002i/dmodel)PE(pos,2i+1)=cos(pos/100002i/dmodel)whereposis the position andiis the dimension. That is, each dimension of the positional encodingcorresponds to a sinusoid. The wavelengths form a geometric progression from2πto10000·2π. Wechose this function because we hypothesized it would allow the model to easily learn to attend byrelative positions, since for any ﬁxed offsetk,PEpos+kcan be represented as a linear function ofPEpos.4Why Self-AttentionIn this section we compare various aspects of self-attention layers to the recurrent and convolu-tional layers commonly used for mapping one variable-length sequence of symbol representations5\n",

Motivating our use of self-attention weconsider three desiderata.One is the total computational complexity per layer. Another is the amount of computation that canbe parallelized, as measured by the minimum number of sequential operations required.The third is the path length between long-range dependencies in the network. Learning long-rangedependencies is a key challenge in many sequence transduction tasks. One key factor affecting theability to learn such dependencies is the length of the paths forward and backward signals have totraverse in the network. The shorter these paths between any combination of positions in the inputand output sequences, the easier it is to learn long-range dependencies [11]. Hence we also comparethe maximum path length between any two input and output positions in networks composed of thedifferent layer types.As noted in Table 1, a self-attention layer connects all positions with a constant number of sequentiallyexecuted operations, whereas a recurrent layer requiresO(n)sequential operations. In terms ofcomputational complexity, self-attention layers are faster than recurrent layers when the sequencelengthnis smaller than the representation dimensionalityd, which is most often the case withsentence representations used by state-of-the-art models in machine translations, such as word-piece[34] and byte-pair [28] representations. To improve computational performance for tasks involvingvery long sequences, self-attention could be restricted to considering only a neighborhood of sizerinthe input sequence centered around the respective output position. This would increase the maximumpath length toO(n/r). We plan to investigate this approach further in future work.A single convolutional layer with kernel widthk < ndoes not connect all pairs of input and outputpositions. Doing so requires a stack ofO(n/k)convolutional layers in the case of contiguous kernels,orO(logk(n))in the case of dilated convolutions [16], increasing the length of the longest pathsbetween any two positions in the network. Convolutional layers are generally more expensive thanrecurrent layers, by a factor ofk. Separable convolutions [6], however, decrease the complexityconsiderably, toO(k·n·d+n·d2). Even withk=n, however, the complexity of a separableconvolution is equal to the combination of a self-attention layer and a point-wise feed-forward layer,the approach we take in our model.As side beneﬁt, self-attention could yield more interpretable models. We inspect attention distributionsfrom our models and present and discuss examples in the appendix. Not only do individual attentionheads clearly learn to perform different tasks, many appear to exhibit behavior related to the syntacticand semantic structure of the sentences.5TrainingThis section describes the training regime for our models.5.1Training Data and BatchingWe trained on the standard WMT 2014 English-German dataset consisting of about 4.5 millionsentence pairs.

Each trainingbatch contained a set of sentence pairs containing approximately 25000 source tokens and 25000target tokens.5.2Hardware and ScheduleWe trained our models on one machine with 8 NVIDIA P100 GPUs. For our base models usingthe hyperparameters described throughout the paper, each training step took about 0.4 seconds. Wetrained the base models for a total of 100,000 steps or 12 hours. For our big models,(described on thebottom line of table 3), step time was 1.0 seconds, and the models were trained for 300,000 steps or3.5 days.5.3OptimizerWe used the Adam optimizer [18] withβ1= 0.9,β2= 0.98andϵ= 10−9. We varied the learningrate over the course of training, according to the formula:lrate=d−0.5model·min(step_num−0.5, step_num·warmup_steps−1.5)(3)This corresponds to increasing the learning rate linearly for the ﬁrstwarmup_stepstraining steps,and decreasing it thereafter proportionally to the inverse square root of the step number. We usedwarmup_steps= 4000.5.4RegularizationWe employ three types of regularization during training:Residual DropoutWe apply dropout [30] to the output of each sub-layer, before it is added to thesub-layer input and normalized. In addition, we apply dropout to the sums of the embeddings and thepositional encodings in both the encoder and decoder stacks. For the base model, we use a rate ofPdrop= 0.1.Attention DropoutQuery to key attentions are structurally similar to hidden-to-hidden weights ina feed-forward network, albeit across positions. The softmax activations yielding attention weightscan then be seen as the analogue of hidden layer activations. A natural possibility is to extend dropout[30] to attention. We implement attention dropout by dropping out attention weights as,Attention(Q, K, V) = dropout(softmax(QKT√d))VIn addition to residual dropout, we found attention dropout to be beneﬁcial for our parsing experi-ments.Label SmoothingDuring training, we employed label smoothing of valueϵls= 0.1[32]. Thishurts perplexity, as the model learns to be more unsure, but improves accuracy and BLEU score.6Results6.1Machine TranslationOn the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, Our big transformer model (Transformer(big) in Table 2) outperforms the best previously reported models (including ensembles) by morethan2.0BLEU, establishing a new state-of-the-art BLEU score of28.4. The conﬁguration of thismodel is listed in the bottom line of Table 3. Training took3.5days on8P100 GPUs. Even our basemodel surpasses all previously published models and ensembles, at a fraction of the training cost ofany of the previous best models.7\n",

The Transformer (big) model trained for English-to-French useddropout ratePdrop= 0.1, instead of0.3.For the base models, we used a single model obtained by averaging the last 5 checkpoints, whichwere written at 10-minute intervals. For the big models, we averaged the last 20 checkpoints. Weused beam search with a beam size of4and length penaltyα= 0.6[34]. These hyperparameterswere chosen after experimentation on the development set. We set the maximum output length duringinference to input length +50, but terminate early when possible [34].Table 2 summarizes our results and compares our translation quality and training costs to other modelarchitectures from the literature. We estimate the number of ﬂoating point operations used to train amodel by multiplying the training time, the number of GPUs used, and an estimate of the sustainedsingle-precision ﬂoating-point capacity of each GPU3.6.2Model VariationsTo evaluate the importance of different components of the Transformer, we varied our base modelin different ways, measuring the change in performance on English-to-German translation on thedevelopment set, newstest2013. We used beam search as described in the previous section, but nocheckpoint averaging. We present these results in Table 3.In Table 3 rows (A), we vary the number of attention heads and the attention key and value dimensions,keeping the amount of computation constant, as described in Section 3.2.2. While single-headattention is 0.9 BLEU worse than the best setting, quality also drops off with too many heads.In Table 3 rows (B), we observe that reducing the attention key sizedkhurts model quality. Thissuggests that determining compatibility is not easy and that a more sophisticated compatibilityfunction than dot product may be beneﬁcial. We further observe in rows (C) and (D) that, as expected,bigger models are better, and dropout is very helpful in avoiding over-ﬁtting.6.3English Constituency ParsingTo evaluate if the Transformer can generalize to other tasks we performed experiments on Englishconstituency parsing. This task presents speciﬁc challenges: the output is subject to strong structuralconstraints and is signiﬁcantly longer than the input. Furthermore, RNN sequence-to-sequencemodels have not been able to attain state-of-the-art results in small-data regimes [33].We trained a 4-layer transformer withdmodel= 1024on the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) portion of thePenn Treebank [23], about 40K training sentences. We also trained it in a semi-supervised setting,using the larger high-conﬁdence and BerkleyParser corpora from with approximately 17M sentences3We used values of 2.8, 3.7, 6.0 and 9.5 TFLOPS for K80, K40, M40 and P100, respectively.8\n",

      "Sentence: 7ConclusionIn this work, we presented the Transformer, the ﬁrst sequence transduction model based entirely onattention, replacing the recurrent layers most commonly used in encoder-decoder architectures withmulti-headed self-attention.For translation tasks, the Transformer can be trained signiﬁcantly faster than architectures basedon recurrent or convolutional layers. On both WMT 2014 English-to-German and WMT 2014English-to-French translation tasks, we achieve a new state of the art. In the former task our bestmodel outperforms even all previously reported ensembles. We also provide an indication of thebroader applicability of our models through experiments on English constituency parsing.We are excited about the future of attention-based models and plan to apply them to other tasks. Weplan to extend the Transformer to problems involving input and output modalities other than text andto investigate local, restricted attention mechanisms to efﬁciently handle large inputs and outputssuch as images, audio and video. Making generation less sequential is another research goals of ours.We intend to make the code we used to train and evaluate our models available soon.References[1]Jimmy Lei Ba, Jamie Ryan Kiros, and Geoffrey E Hinton.
